# FuelCycleAnalyses
This repository is for the fuel cycle analysis and optimization of light water reactors (using LEU+ fuel to acheive a 24 month cycle length) and advanced systems. More information on how to clone this repo, and our objectives and methods can be found in [the wiki](https://github.gatech.edu/dkotlyar6/LEUplus/wiki/Modelling-and-Assumptions)
